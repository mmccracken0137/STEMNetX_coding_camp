    "Welcome back!  You'll recall that in our last lesson we worked with some of the basic capabilities of `python` and Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "1. Jupyter notebooks allow us to combine markdown cells (like this one) with code cells (that actually execute `python` code).\n",
    "1. Basic mathematical operations: `+, - , *, /, %`\n",
    "1. Variable declaration and storing numerical values in variables.  This is done with the `=` operator.\n",
    "1. Basic run-time errors.  If your code doesn't run, `python` sometimes offers helpful error reports.\n",
    "1. Function definition using keywords `def` and `return`.\n",
    "1. Basic loop structure using keyword `for`.\n",

    "## Control structures\n",
    "\n",
    "*Control structures* are things that... um... control the way that our code will run.  Broadly, control structures fall into two categories:\n",
    "- allow us to make the computer do repetitive tasks (*loops*)\n",
    "- allow us to make the computer's behavior depend on parameters in our calculation or other inputs (*conditionals*).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with **loops**.  We use a loop when we need to perform some task over and over and over and over again.  In the previous lesson we talked about *why* it is a good thing that we have computers to do this mindless work for us.  The vast majority of the calculations we do in the physical sciences are doable with pencil and paper -- however, the manual approach would take so long that these calculations would be *effectively* impossible.  The automation of such calcultions with computers has advanced science a great deal since the 1940s!  For an example, check out the [history of the cracking of the German Enigma machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2_Q9FoD-oQ&ab_channel=Numberphile).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where loops are concerned, we distinguish between two types of implementations/calculations:\n",
    "- **Iteration** -- the simplest type of loop calculations, performing a repetitive task over and over, say $N$ times.  In an iteration problem, we could in principle begin our calculations anywhere in the series of calculations.  In Lesson 0 we saw an interation problem where we added up all of the numbers between 0 and 2022.\n",
    "- **Recursion** -- this is more challenging type of loop in which the execution of the $n^{th}$ step through the loop depends on the result of the $(n-1)^{th}$ step.  For a recursion problem, we can't simply start wherever; we need to do the calculation in order and keep track of the values at each step in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic types of loop control structures: definite and indefinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definite Loops, `for`\n",
    "\n",
    "A definite loop is one that must happen a fixed number of times, AND we *know* this number of times before we begin running our program.  In `python`, this is most easily/compactly achieved with the `for` loop.  A `for` loop performs the tasks inside of the loop FOR (get it?) a fixed number of times.  The syntax for writing a `for` loop in python looks like this:"

    "- The indentation tells python what instructions happen \"inside\" the loop.  The first line that's not indented is not part of the loop.\n",
    "- Note the colon (`:`) in this syntax.  The colon works like it does in english syntax: \"Hey, computer, do the following things: print 0, print 1, print 2, print 3, ...\"  \n",
    "- Note that the stuff that the computer does in the loop doesn't change; rather, it's the value of the variable `i` that is changing!\n",
    "- `range()` is a compact way of setting the parameters of a `for` loop.  `range(N)` generates a list of numbers between 0 and `N-1`.  Note that this default behavior considers the \"first ten integers\" to be the numbers 0 through 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "The defining characteristic of a `for` loop is that the loop behavior is *hard coded* into the loop.  (Without any additional code) You could read the program and know how many times it will execute.\n",

    "\n",
    "Even though the syntax is basic, there are many interesting ways to use a `for` loop.  In our previous lesson you saw how we used `for` to sum series, compute interest, and map out the values of a polynomial function.\n",

I don't know (yet)!\n",

In the future, we'll see how to iterate over more general lists of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, and this is usually true of `while` loop implementations, the current calculation of the loop depends on a calculation done in the previous instance of the loop.  Said another way, each time we go through the loop, we produce some values that are used the *next* time the loop is executed.  This process is called **recursion**, and the loop and it's calculation are said to be **recursive**.  The interest calculation that we did above (with a loop) is a recursive calculation because the balance in year $n$ depends on the balance in the year $n-1$.\n",
