    "Most modern research fields involve collecting data and then \"analyzing\" this data to produce results.  A straight-forward example would be something like the US Census; data (information from each household) is collected, and then an analysis is performed to produce aggregate results like family income distributions, demographics, *etc.*  Very rarely in science are collected data and results the same thing -- we ofen have to analyze our measurements to generate some *knowledge or wisdom*.\n",
