The first thing we need to know about is the idea of bits. All information in a computer (numbers, programs, memes, etc.) are represented by high and low voltages. These might a specific location on a hard drive which as it a high voltage (ed. note: massive simplification). These locations are called *bits*, and when discussing a bit at a high voltage we say is has a value of 1, and a low voltage is 0. \n",

    "Enough goofin' around, let's get to quantum computers. So what is a QC? A regular computer's hard drive and processors are made up of different forms of silicon microchips, which are small but still consist of many many atomes. A QC uses single atoms. Each bit in a QC is actually a single atom, called a *qubit*, for *quantum bit*. Atoms, it turns out, spin. And a qubit in the *1* state might be spinning in one direction, and a *qubit* in the *0* state might be spinning in the opposite direction.\n",

    "Note that there can diffeerent ways of making a QC, such that you are not actually using atoms, but atoms are the easiest way to visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of a QC is that atoms can be in a weird combination of *1* and *0* states at the same time. Why is this good? On a classical computer, if we wanted to run our half-adder for all four possible input configurations, we have to run that code 4 separate times, changing the input each time. You did this above. For a QC, if we prepare each qubit in a combination of both *1* and *0*, then if set it up right, we only have to run the code once, since all possible input configurations are already present. This might sound small, but with lots of qubits and millions of input configurations, this can save a TREMENDOUS amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the moment, we want to learn how to code up our half-adder on a QC. IBM has built a set of actual QCs that anyone can use, and then created some tools to interface with them. These tools are called **Qiskit**, which we will learn now. \n",

    "\n",
    "This is just a a taste of how to program a QC. Learning about the real advantage of a QC takes more math and physics, and obviously you don't need a next-gen computer to add 1 and 1, but there are many many other gates and algorithms for solving complex problems. IBM's page on [Quantum Learning](http://qiskit.org/learn/) has way more activities and information, including a certificate program.\n",
    "\n",
    " If you want to explore and learn more, that IBM page is a good place to start, but it get's very mathy very quickly. You can start with some of the following problems:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. Learn what a full-adder is, what role is plays in adding two arbitrary numbers, and implement that using Qiskit.\n",
    " 2. Learn what a Hadamard Gate is and how to implement it, and see what happens when initialize your bits using it.\n",
    " 3. There are other standard classical gates, like *OR* and *NOR* (neither or), and *XNOR* (exclusive or). Figure out what each of these do classically, and how implement them with Qiskit. Code them up with Qiskit and verify they give the output you expect.\n",
    " 4. Quantum Computers need to be *reversible*, meaning that if you take the output of any quantum circuit, and run it backwards through the same computer, you recover the input qubits. This is not true for regular computers, in that if the calculator on my computer gives me a *6*, I can't run it backwards and figure out if that came from 2 times 3 or 6 times 1. Come up with some random set of quantum gates and input qubits, run it, and then figure out how to run it backwards and verify your circuit is reversible.\n"
