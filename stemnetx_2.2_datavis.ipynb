    "## Data Visualization as an idea\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"data visualization\" is a visual representation of quantitative information in some form that is intuitively digestible to human brains.  \"Good\" visualizations allow the user to derive understanding and meaning from quantitative information that would be otherwise unintelligible, hidden, or high-level.  \"Bad\" visualizations either do not allow for understanding (*i.e.*, they are confusing or unintuitive) or lead the user to a *wrong/incorrect* understanding.  Note that some (many?) visualizations are **intentionally** misleading -- a bad actor who wants to incorrect conclusions might consider a bad visualization (as defined above) to be good!\n",
    "\n",
    "Making a good/effective visualization involves quantitive literacy, technical skill (programming in this case), creativity, artistry/style, and psychology.  That said, there seems to be a core set of *types* of data visualizations, things like time-series data, histograms, and bi-variate scatter plots.  In many cases, the understanding that we hope to gain from data can be conveyed via one of these standard types.  \n",
    "\n",
    "THAT said, we now live in an era of complex, multidimensional datasets -- having more flexible visualization tools allows researchers to develop new ways to seek meaning in data, rather than having tools dictate what meaning we can seek.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data --> Analysis --> Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming skills that we've learned so far form the backbone of data analysis.  With a few simple visualization tools, we will be able to turn our analyses into compelling evidence.  "

Because `python` is used by so many wonderful folks in the natural and data sciences, many of these modules are designed to do *exactly* the types of things that we want to do in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such module, `matplotlib`, is a comprehensive suite for data visualization.  In this notebook, we'll use `matplotlib` to produce a few of the basic visualization types.\n",
    "\n",

    "Suppose we have a dataset that is a collection of values of a *single type* (imagine a single column in a spreadsheet).\n",
    "Examples would be like US household incomes from a census, or students' grades on an exam in a given class.  You might think about calculating the mean, median, and mode values of the data, but these individual values probably are not a comprehensive characterization of the data.  If I tell you that the average score on an exam was 75\\%, did everyone get a 75\\% or did half the class ace the exam and the other half fail???\n",
    "\n",
    "We could certainly open the file that contains this data and just scroll through it, hoping to gain some insight about how the values are distributed, but for large datasets it's unlikely that this will yield any (correct) understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "A (1-d) **histogram** is a visual representation of 1-dimensional data that allows the viewer to quickly understand how the data is *distributed*.  To make a histogram, we split the full range of data values into smaller ranges called *bins* and then visualize how many values from the dataset fall into (or occupy) each bin.  You may have worked with bar graphs, which are related to histograms.  Note that this approach takes 1-d data and turns it into a 2-d representation (bin properties and occupancies).\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-made histogram allows the user to get an idea of how data is distributed in a glance, and it can lead to more nuanced understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms are very useful, and `matplotlib` has quite a bit of built-in histogram capability that will allow you to make professional plots easily!  Let's take it for a test drive!  In addition to `numpy` we'll need to import `matplotlib.pyplot`, the core plotting module.  Let's work with the `dice_data.txt` referenced in the previous lesson.  We'll make a simple histogram for total dice value."

One possible explanation is that we live in 3 spatial dimensions, which makes projections of data onto 2-d surfaces (like paper or screens) fairly easy to do.  Another possible explanation is that until fairly recently, it has been difficult to make graphs of more than two variables and this means we just have more experience digesting 2-d visualizations.

This error bar indicates to the viewer that we're confident that the *actual* value of the measured quantity is within the range indicated by the error bar.
