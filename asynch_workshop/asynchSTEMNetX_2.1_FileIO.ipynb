    "\n",
    "Most modern research fields involve collecting data and then \"analyzing\" this data to produce results.  A straight-forward example would be something like the US Census; data (information from each household) is collected, and then an analysis is performed to produce aggregate results like family income distributions, demographics, *etc.*  Very rarely in science are collected data and results the same thing -- we often have to analyze the results of our measurements (the \"raw data\") to generate some *knowledge or wisdom* (the \"results\").\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have analyzed data earlier in your life with a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel, and this is fine for some tasks.\n",
    "Excel and similar make the dataset and the analysis the same entity: you enter both the data and calculations into the same spreadsheet document.\n",
    "When datasets get LARGE or one is interested in more sophisticated or multi-dimensional analyses, Excel (or similar) is inefficient, confusing, incapable, and in some cases *dangerous*.\n",

    "We've now seen that computers are better than humans at completing repetitive, tedious tasks.\n",
    "Computers are also arguiably better than humans at relibly storing and retrieving data.  Once we've generated a large dataset, we want to store it in a file, and (hopefully) retreive that data for later analysis.
