    "## What is Monte Carlo?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo Casino is a famous gambling and entertainment establishment (*i.e.*, a casino) located in the country of Monaco.  It is *very* fancy -- so fancy, in fact, that James Bond has been there in **two** separate films.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, thanks for coming by!  Have a great life.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Monte Carlo technique?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo method is a paradigm (or type of approach) to solving problems.  Like most things, the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) entry is very good if you already know what Monte Carlo is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Monte Carlo methods... are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, Monte Carlo is a way of studying systems or processes that are too complex, or are inherently non-deterministic, to provide definitive predictions.  A Monte Carlo analysis builds a statistical model of the behavior of a system, performs *many* simulations/trials of the system, and then generates a statistical understanding of the outcomes of the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "MC isn't *a* technique so much as it is a way of approaching certain types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Believe it or not, we already (crudely) applied the MC technique back when we introduced the concept of and syntax for random number generation.  Many MC techniques rely on random number generation to sample the possible states or behaviors of a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a two examples of how we can use the MC approach to generate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "MC gets its name from the city of Monte Carlo.  How do you investigate these systems that are too complicated?  We roll the dice; *i.e.*, we generate some random numbers.  That's the connection to gambling."

    "## *De rigueur* example: Calculating $\\pi$ using the MC method\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the number $\\pi$ is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter (in a flat space with Euclidean metric...).  $\\pi$ is WILD! It is a transcendental number; *i.e.*, it's not the root of a finite polynomial with rational coefficients.  It pops up in many unexpected places in the mathematical and physical sciences!  Previously in this workshop we approximated $\\pi$ using infinite series, but that required us to know the expressions for these series!\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that we don't know the value of $\\pi$... well, at least not the *exact* value of $\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine a world in which we don't know the numerical value of $\\pi$ to any precision.  Is it 3? 4? Somewhere in between?  How would we go about *measuring* it?  We could make many, many, many circles, measure their diameters and circumferences, calculate the ratio for each, and perhaps average... But it's probably unfeasible to carefully fabricate many very precise circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another way to measure (or approximate) the value of $\\pi$.  Recall that the area of a circle with unit radius is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (1)^2 = \\pi$.  Let's picture a circle with radius $1$ drawn inside a square with side length $2$, both centered at the origin in the $x$-$y$ plane.  We'll let the square occupy the region with $x\\in [-1, 1]$ and $y\\in[-1, 1]$.  You can scroll down to peel at the visualization below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine throwing $N$ darts at this figure in such a way that each dart lands with a random $(x, y)$ position somewhere inside the square.  Some number of these darts, $N_c$, will land inside the circle.  If the $(x, y)$ positions of the darts are truly randomly distributed inside the square, we expect that the probability of a dart landing in the circle, $p_c$, is equal to the fraction of the total area that is inside the circle:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "  p_c = \\frac{A_c}{A} = \\frac{\\pi}{2^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that if we don't know a value for $\\pi$, **this probability is unknown to us**.  We can't calculate it from other quantities; rather, we need some way to measure it!  This is a feature common to many MC applications -- there is some important probability (or probability distribution) that we don't know, but that we want to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will \"measure\" this probability by **sampling**!  (Note: We are going to do this with code, but you could totally do the same approximation with real darts on a real [not-college-owned] wall.)  We will randomly generate $N$ positions in the square, observe how many of these ($N_c$) fall within the circle, and then approximate\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  p_c = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\approx \\frac{N_c}{N} \\implies \\pi \\approx 4\\frac{N_c}{N}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this approximation is... APPROXIMATE!  Since $\\pi$ is transcendental, it cannot be expressed as a fraction, and thus there are NO values of $N_c$ and $N$ that will make the equality perfect.  However, the more we sample (the larger $N$ is), the better (on average) our approximate should be.\n",
